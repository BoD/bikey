Bikey
=====

Bikey is a bike computer for Android.

Use it to record your rides, and display useful information:
- current speed
- ride duration
- total distance
- average moving speed
- compass
- current time.

Bikey is best used with a bike mount: the data is displayed in full screen with a large font for visibility,
and a single tap cycles through the different information.

Data can be exported in .gpx format.
